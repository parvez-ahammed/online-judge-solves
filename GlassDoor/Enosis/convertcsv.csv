After passing the first phase, they called me within a week for the arrangement of 2nd phase schedule. It was online interview test of 1.5hrs and I had to code in C#. In the interview, the interviewers were very supportive.
At first, they had given a string alignment problem. It was a pyramid type paragraph with middle alignment, I had to convert all the rows into left align. After solving it, the interviewer asked various questions from my code. He thoroughly checked my code and asked me questions for better understanding of my coding approach.
After solving first problem, I was told to solve it with stringBuilder(a feature of C#). It was new concept for me at that time. So they conducted 5mins of lecture about stringbuilder. Then I was told to solve with it. Unfortunately I could not manage to solve it within the given time.
I received a declination email after 3days. They said they will call me again if there is any suitable position available. Then after one month they had offered me for SQA position.

Software Development Engineer Interview,"The Interview took place in three phases:
1. Applying to Enosis Solutions.
2. Getting shortlisted for the written exam.
3. Getting shortlisted for the technical exam.
After applying and getting shortlisted for the recruitment, I went there for my written exam. There were 4 analytical problems, 6 programming problems and 5 system testing problems. We were given 1 hour of time to solve them all. So BE AWARE of time. The problems were really easy. Analytical problems were from Geometry, Basic Math, Age calculation etc. And the programming problem section was basic. If you have gone through your basic C programming course in your academic life, you shouldn't face any problem. The testing part consisted of testing different OOP classes and applications.
After some days, I got to know that I was selected for the technical exam. The technical exam will be conducted by a senior software engineer who will help you understand the environment and the problems.
The worst part begins HERE. From the very 2017, the same questions with same Visual Studio environment have been asking out to candidates and they chose candidates from the same implementation knowledge! After my technical exam, I shared my coding experience with one of my friends who was waiting for his technical exam and guess what? He got the SAME question with same environment and solved all the problems ( there are two(2) problems in total. If you can solve the first one,then you will be given the second one. )AND he got the job too! My friend has a sound programming background. Whether we had the discussion or not, he could have managed the job easily. But should it be the correct WAY for judging a candidate? Should you judge a candidate by throwing a problem to him like "" this is our personal project and this is our code base, align the string from left to right "" and same problem for ALL the candidate from 2017?
It took some time to understand their environment and I solved the tasks they gave to me. But I was told that I took much time in my first problem so they can't enroll me in the Software Engineer section. They further offered me in QA section and I happily declined.",Align a string to right from left.,Declined Offer

Software Engineer Interview,They will shortlist you by going through your CV. Then you will be invited to a written test which is about 1 hour. There will be about 14-15 questions to test your coding skills. Also some analytical questions. After passing the written part you will be called for the system testing. They will inform you within 7 days whether you are selected or not. But the saddest and worst part about this company is they don't hire a girl. May be because of their personal reasons or what so.

Software Engineer Interview,"A written test is taken which was pretty easy. Simple math, easy coding problems and some questions regarding testing were given.
After that, a coding test was situated where 2 problems were asked to solve. 1st problem was to make text right aligned. 2nd problem was to output a directory like structure given a vector representing child-parent relationship. Interviewer failed to properly describe 2nd problem which was pretty disappointing.",How would you implement center aligned text?,No Offer
Software Engineer Interview,"No verbal interview if I don't consider over the phone informal conversations as interviews. A written test was followed by a coding test. I felt that the Written test was too trivial to differentiate candidates. The worst part was candidates appearing for the test on different days happened to get the exact same questions. Same thing happened in the coding interview too.
Coding interview Setup was good, completing some functions in the backend of a C++ GUI application. All logical, they described the APIs to use very well. Still they could've told the candidates about the coding environment beforehand as does some online coding interviews. Still the worst part is candidates appearing on different dates get the exact same problems to solve making it really unfair for the earlier candidates.",To describe myself informally,Declined Offer
Software Engineer Interview,"The interview process for the position of Software Engineer includes three levels. First you will be called for a written exam, after two weeks of that they will let you know if you have successfully passed the exam or not and will call you for an interview and a coding test.","The written exam was of 1 hour and included the following questions: (1) Write a function that will receive a string as an input and will return the string in reverse order. (2) Write a function that will print the following series of numbers using only one loop: ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1"" (3) Write a function that will print all the multiples of 3 between 1-200 ( in reverse order ) There were other programming questions as well but of the same difficulty level. Along with the coding questions there were some analytical and QA questions as well. And for me the best part of this exam was there's no language specification. You can answer all the coding questions in whichever programming language you are comfortable with. So, after giving the exam I was impressed to know that they basically want to see how much problem solving skills do you have rather than evaluating you by the number of languages and frameworks you know.",Accepted Offer

Software Engineer Interview,"it was a very lengthy and boring process. first they take written exam in February. then technical interview in march. then skill test in April.
In written exam,
1. there is some basic questions from math like simple probability finding, finding age of father from son's age, angle finding, perimeter, circle related problem. very easy questions. it may have 1-2 mcq.
2. Then there is coding questions. first questions will be - what are the basic concepts of OOP and write a code to implement them. after this there will be some coding problem- like string reverse etc. Also there will be some question like- what will be the output of this code and why?
for example, you will be given a simple recursive code and draw its tree. please read about constructor calling.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 write this code in one loop.
3. then there will be sql related questions. like write sql queries. - find the max, 2nd max salary, swap two columns of two table etc. practice some query. it may have 1-2 mcq.
4. then there will be questions from QA. like difference among white,black, gray box testing. then there will be picture find out diff in those pictures, then there will be some scenario - you have to write how will you test it or how you will you improve it.
very easy questions. write as your wish.
last questions will be what is your most memorable achievement, describe... :P
for written section I write what I remember from my written exam.. Don't worry questions are very easy.
In first interview,
there will be two persons. one is hr and another is technical. first question will be describe your self...:P
then technical will ask question from your CV. most question from projects. easy basic questions. then hr will ask about your future plan,expected salary(:D), your family etc....
third time they call you for skill test.
i was given a test which was right align, i had to make it left align. you have code in visual studio 2010 in C++. it was a windows application. you just need to edit the right align code to make it left align. there is some other alignment function , they may tell you write code for them also...:P
about visual studio 10, if you write something like this:
vector<int>vc;
for(int i=0; i<vc.size();i++) // your code will not run. i faced this problem which cost me huge time.. :(
