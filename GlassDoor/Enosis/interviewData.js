The codes were of simple problems like reversing words of a sentence, printing numbers that occur only once in an array etc. The written test was of 1 hour duration. A piece of advice, give revision if you have time, surprising mistakes can be made when you write a code on paper instead of a computer.\nAfter the written test, if you are rejected, they notify you with an email in a few days. If you pass, they schedule a date for coding test and calls you again for that.\nIn the coding test, 2 problems were given. The first problem was of a string alignment conversion and the second problem was of creating a tree using a node insertion function they will provide based on a list of relationships between some entities.

There were 4 analytical problems, 6 programming problems and 5 system testing problems. We were given 1 hour of time to solve them all. So BE AWARE of time. The problems were really easy. Analytical problems were from Geometry, Basic Math, Age calculation etc. And the programming problem section was basic. If you have gone through your basic C programming course in your academic life, you shouldn't face any problem. The testing part consisted of testing different OOP classes and applications.\nAfter some days, I got to know that I was selected for the technical exam. The technical exam will be conducted by a senior software engineer who will help you understand the environment and the problems.\nThe worst part begins HERE. From the very 2017, the same questions with same Visual Studio environment have been asking out to candidates and they chose candidates from the same implementation knowledge! After my technical exam, I shared my coding experience with one of my friends who was waiting for his technical exam and guess what? He got the SAME question with same environment and solved all the problems ( there are two(2) problems in total. If you can solve the first one,then you will be given the second one. )AND he got the job too! My friend has a sound programming background. Whether we had the discussion or not, he could have managed the job easily. But should it be the correct WAY for judging a candidate? Should you judge a candidate by throwing a problem to him like \" this is our personal project and this is our code base, align the string from left to right \" and same problem for ALL the candidate from 2017?\nIt took some time to understand their environment and I solved the tasks they gave to me. But I was told that I took much time in my first problem so they can't enroll me in the Software Engineer section. They further offered me in QA section and I happily declined.",
