You'll be given some text in a file. The text in the file can be left align, right-align, or center align. You need to align those texts with the interviewer's choice.

* Reverse string in words wises not characters.
* Coding test question is same as previous exam ! I dont know why they dont change their question . First question was about center aligning string from a plain string Second question was about binary hierarchical tree that can make parent child relationship. If you can solve first problem ,but you cant write code for second problem they will not hire you . Make sure you can solve second problem . The question is same ,so you need to find answers from Ex- Enosis Employee at any how . A continious same tree problem can't judge you overall! Be patient, try another company if you cant hire by them One more tipis: They take coding interview in C# language with Visual Studio(Not Visual Studio Code). You need to complete a method function in class . You need to pass value to another method to show output .

* Take input from file where each line contains a integer and find average

* Reverse string

* Written: Very basic level problems. Also they are repetitive. Coding: Same right-alighment problem + Tree construction problem.

* Reverse a sentence.

* Reverse a String, Print a sequence, find an error in the code.

* Write a code for reading all the files in a folder

* Q1: They will provide a code base. A function will be implemented for either right align, left align or center align of a passage. You will need to tweak the given function for expected alignment asked. Q2: id name parent_id 1 abcd -1 2 bcdf 1 3 efgh 2 normalNode{ id; name; parentId; } treeNode n = add(string name, treeNode parentNode) //normal treeNode n = add(string name) //parent make a tree out of these given list structure.

* Write a function to reverse each word of a given string.

* Align a string to right from left.

* String right alignment , Map Vector Tree related problems.

* You are asked to write the code for right-aligning a text in a text-box.

* 1. Take input from file.

* During the coding test they asked me to align some string to the right.

* questions are like reverse array,print multiple of 3's and also some analytical questions.

* The written exam was of 1 hour and included the following questions: (1) Write a function that will receive a string as an input and will return the string in reverse order. (2) Write a function that will print the following series of numbers using only one loop: "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1" (3) Write a function that will print all the multiples of 3 between 1-200 ( in reverse order ) There were other programming questions as well but of the same difficulty level. Along with the coding questions there were some analytical and QA questions as well. And for me the best part of this exam was there's no language specification. You can answer all the coding questions in whichever programming language you are comfortable with. So, after giving the exam I was impressed to know that they basically want to see how much problem solving skills do you have rather than evaluating you by the number of languages and frameworks you know.

* 1.Reverse a string ( eg: input : cats and dogs , output : dogs and cats ) 2. print the series using only one loop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 3. find duplicates in an array. 4. print multiples of 3 from 200 to 1 etc coding test : give a window size . some texts are left align , make it right align .

* Write code of 1st 100 Prime number series, Fibonnaci series. Testing related questions.
